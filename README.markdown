# Rajesh's dotfiles

## About

These include some helpful shortcuts and settings I've become accustomed to. 
Please feel free to use/copy/steal whatever you see here because I've done the same in order to find the perfect fit for myself.

## Install


    ## Shell dotfiles

    Please install zsh before installing this
    git clone https://github.com/rajeshgaikwad/dotfiles.git dotfiles
    cd dotfiles
    install_dotfiles.sh
    Personally, I use [my own fork of oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/rajeshgaikwad/oh-my-zsh) and therefore run this command after bootstrapping.
